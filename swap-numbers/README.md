#Swap Numbers

Write a program that, given a sentence where each word has a single digit positive integer as a prefix and suffix, swaps the numbers while retaining the word in between. Words in the sentence are delimited from each other by a space.

The first argument is a path to a file. Each line of the input file contains one test case represented by a sentence. Each word in the sentence begins and ends with a single digit positive integer i.e. 0 through 9. Assume all characters are ASCII.
